  <h2 style="color:red;">You are using Sight Beta.</h2>
  <p>Beta versions of iBallexus products, before first release, are always free until released. After that, you will be required to (at least) have a Ballin subscription. Expect some bugs with this software. We will work on getting them fixed. When a new version is released, you will no longer be able to use this application.</p>
